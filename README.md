# Crop Disease Detection Using Deep Learning:
Developed deep learning-based image classification models using a custom CNN and ResNet50 architecture to automatically identify and categorize crop diseases from leaf images. Leveraged the PlantVillage dataset, covering multiple crops like apple, cherry, corn, grape, potato, strawberry, and tomato. Applied data augmentation, preprocessing, and multi-class classification, resulting in high-performance models effective for real-world agricultural disease detection
